Python Autograder for Canvas (pac)
 
This is an autograder I created for Dr. Coffman's (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~sscw/) CS 303E class.

This can be used for grading Cavas assignments at the current state as long as:
*** MOST IMPORTANTLY *** 1. Create secret.py and provide the variable API_TOKEN containing your api key from canvas
2. You provide the course ids in canvashelper.py
3. Your students provide their python program in their assignment submission

A more modular version will be implemented in the future, but this serves the purpose of grading python
programs that take a specific input (or not) and display a specific output.
